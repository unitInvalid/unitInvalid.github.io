It also makes it more useful than ever. You can now quickly adjust the volume on-screen using the slider, conveniently placed next to the volume buttons. And if you need to quickly hide the volume HUD, you can simply swipe it off the screen. Want to adjust the ringer volume instead? Tap on the speaker icon and watch it turn into a bell.\n\n### Designed for iPhone X.\n\nFor the first time ever, the volume HUD is optimized for iPhone X and higher. Ultrasound allows you to see the volume level and percentage at a glance, as you adjust it while the screen is off. It seamlessly animates in and out of OLED Mode as you wake your device, and combined with OLED's true black pixels, it looks amazing.\n\n---\n\n**Ultrasound is now free!** If you purchased it in the last 14 days, you're entitled to a full refund. Follow the instructions [here](https://repo.dynastic.co/refunds) to open a request.",
